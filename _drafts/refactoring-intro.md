Refactoring is changing the internal structure of code without changing its external behavior.

That way:
  - Refactoring is done to already existing code that works
  - Nothing to "fix"
  
  
You already have refactored in your life. Have you ever renamed a variable? Have you picked up some lines of code, created a new method, placed them in that method and called it where they were?
