There are many definitions for software architecture, here, let's say it is the big picture of the system.
Now, what should your architecture's goal be? What should it encourage in the developers?

Our architecture should not try to be perfect up front, simply because no one can predict the future.
Should we give up, then? Nah, just a different goal: embrace change.
We should make sure our architecture enables our software to adapt quickly to changes, triggered by new information that
we learn as the problem and the sofware matures.
