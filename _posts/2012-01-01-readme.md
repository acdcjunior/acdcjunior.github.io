This is an example post, just used to configure the main features of the blog. Soon enough I will delete this post, so that only useful posts will be left in this blog. I am also using this post to test the main features of this blog theme, by basically varying the numerous attributes in the front matter and in the markdown language too. I hope you enjoy the final blog.

### Data Generation

1. MMA_query.R:
  * Summarizes html from individual fighters finding additional fighters via links to opponents and organizations
  * Summarized vegas odds from fighters and their opponents
2. MMA_makeDB.R:
  * Using results of MMA_query combine data across fighters to summarize fighter vital stats and fight histories
  * Cleans up inconsistencies and summarizes results into a few high frequency classes
3. MMA_scraping_fxns:
  * Helper functions for MMA_query.R and MMA_makeDB.R
  
### Categorizing MMA Finishes

1. finish_similarity:
  * Aggregating over all fighters look at pairs of finishes that cooccur in individual fighters
  * Determine finishes that reproducibly / statistically-significantly cooccur
  * Generate a network-based summary of the relationship between finishes

### Categorizing Fighter Styles

1. finish_prototypes.R
  * categorizing fighters as a mixture of stylisitic prototypes
  * prototypes have distinctive finishes
  * fighters are mixtures of prototypes
2. LDA_CV_on_cluster.R
  * inferring good parameter values by carrying out cross-validation using a cluster for parallelization
