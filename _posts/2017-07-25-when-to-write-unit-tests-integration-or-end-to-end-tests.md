Who cares about tests?

If you run a rising startup with a now-or-never deadline coming up on the next few days, will you write tests?

No?

Why should you write tests at all, then?

I believe a team won't miss tests at all when:
- They don't care about eventual bugs
- They don't refactor a lot

What those points indicate?

For one, it tells us the team is not worried about being fast consistently. (It does want to go fast, but only when it matters, and at the cost of quality.)
